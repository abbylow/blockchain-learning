# Chainlink
A decentralized oracle network that provides real-world data to smart contracts on the blockchain.

## Chainlink Products
### [CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol)](https://docs.chain.link/ccip)
CCIP provides a single simple interface through which dApps and web3 entrepreneurs can securely meet all their cross-chain needs. You can use CCIP to transfer data, tokens, or both data and tokens across chains.

### [Functions](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-functions)
Functions allows your smart contracts to fetch data from APIs and perform custom computation.

### [Automation](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-automation)
Automation will reliably execute smart contract functions using a variety of triggers, eg: time-based trigger, custom logic trigger (provide custom solidity logic that Automation Nodes evaluate off-chain to determine when to execute your function on-chain), log trigger (use log data to trigger)

### [VRF (Verifiable Random Function)](https://docs.chain.link/vrf)
Chainlink VRF generates one or more random values and cryptographic proof of how those values were determined. The proof is published and verified on-chain before any consuming applications can use it. This process ensures that results cannot be tampered with or manipulated by any single entity including oracle operators, miners, users, or smart contract developers.

### [Data Feeds](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds)
Data Feeds provide a secure, reliable, and decentralized source of off-chain data (such as asset prices, reserve balances, NFT floor prices, and L2 sequencer health) to power unique smart contract use cases for DeFi and beyond.

### [Data Streams](https://docs.chain.link/data-streams)
Data Streams provides low-latency delivery of market data off-chain that you can verify onchain. With Chainlink Data Streams, decentralized applications (dApps) now have on-demand access to high-frequency market data backed by decentralized and transparent infrastructure.
